>As for security reason, it's a common practice that no one upload their crusial credentials and dotenv file.
So, for using it,create a dotenv file in main directory(chatgaiya-chatapp/) and put essential references like,

```js
MONGO_URI = PORT = 5000;
JWT_SECRET = mujib71;
NODE_ENV = production;
```

after equal sign paste your secret values without any spaces. As of now, you understood that you need to make a mongodb atlas account and a cluster for URI, if you're a beginner then you could use online help
